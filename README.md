# OSL-Sketchy_Shader
### Sketch look shader written in Open Shading Language

Occlusion feature need to be polished.

**N.B.** Since version 2.0 a vector input is needed to control shadows direction. It is possible to manage this parameter with drivers (download the .blend file from the page linked below to see how it works).
